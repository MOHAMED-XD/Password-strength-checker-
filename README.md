# Password Strength Checker

This is a small Python project I made while practicing programming.  
The idea is to check how strong or weak a password is by looking at a few simple rules.

## What it does
- Checks if the password is at least 8 characters long
- Looks for digits, lowercase, uppercase, and symbols
- Gives back a result: Weak, Medium, or Strong

## How to run
Clone the repo and run the script:

```bash
python password_checker.py
```

Then type a password when asked and it will tell you if it's weak, medium or strong.

## Example
```
Password Strength Checker
Enter your password: Hello123!
Your password is: Strong
```

## Note
This is not a professional security tool. It's only for learning and practice.
